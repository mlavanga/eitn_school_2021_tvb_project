Description
-----------

This data set contains a simplified subset of data used in [1].

The folder `conn` contains structural connectomes:

  - *_det.zip  ... Individual connectomes built from diffusion imaging with deterministic tractography method
  - *_prob.zip ... Individual connectomes built from diffusion imaging with probabilistic tractography method
  - allen*.zip ... Group connectome built using the tracer studies of Allen Institute. 

The folder `fmri` contains the BOLD signals, two sessions for each mouse.


**Disclaimer**: Compared to the data set used in [1], this data set is simplified and reduced in several undocumented ways.
It is intended for teaching purposes only and it should not be used for any academic work.
